		<p>Our PI, Lena Henningsen, has been named a <a href="https://greencollege.ubc.ca/about">Cecil H. and Ida Green Visiting Professor at the Green College at University of British Columbia</a> and will deliver a round of in-person talks in Vancouver, Canada, at the end of March!</p>

<p>The official visitng scholar lecture and co-organized with the <a href="https://ccr.ubc.ca/">Centre for Chinese Research, UBC</a> will be delivered based on parts of Lena’s recent <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-73383-4">book</a> as a talk titled <strong>“Text in Motion: Unofficial Handwritten Entertainment Fiction from the Chinese Cultural Revolution”</strong>. The lecture will take place on <strong>Tuesday, March 21, from 5-6:30pm,</strong> at Coach House 6201 Cecil Green Park Rd Green College, UBC; a reception will follow.</p>

  <p>Abstract:
The Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966-76) has often been described as a cultural desert; as an era where nothing was permitted and available beyond the brightly colourful yet often utterly boring official propaganda art, as an era in which censorship and government control dominated the literary field. In this talk, Lena Henningsen will demonstrate how analyses of actual reading practices complicate this picture. While for some, the era was a time of cultural and intellectual deprivation and of political persecution, for others it was an time of great diversity, artistic experimentation and literary entertainment. In the first part of her talk, Lena will trace what was actually available to those who dared to venture into the forbidden, including translations of the latest foreign literature, political texts published for party cadres only and manuscript fiction written, copied and rewritten by the educated urban youth sent to the countryside. She will argue that as a consequence of these circumstances, this literary field was constantly in motion: Both the texts and its practitioners (readers, authors, copyists, etc.) were moving across the country, ensuring that the texts were read by multiple readers while at the same time rendering the texts instable when texts, with both printed and handwritten texts rendered incomplete or completely destroyed from tear and wear. In the second part, she will use the example of a spy story that circulated as manuscript fiction to demonstrate that this instability facilitated tremendous creativity of which the multitude of versions of identical stories that survived bear witness. These different versions shed light on crucial aspects of how the Cultural Revolution was experienced at the time. She will conclude by discussing how these literary practices laid the foundation for the tremendous literary creativity of the early post-Maoist years as texts and practitioners moved into a new era.</p>

<p>One day prior, on <strong>Monday, March 20, at 2:00 pm</strong>, Lena will deliver aanother talk based on different parts of her book this time at the <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/davidlamcentre.html">Simon Fraser University David Lam Centre</a>, co-sponsored by the <a href="https://ccr.ubc.ca/">Centre for Chinese Research, UBC</a> and the <a href="https://greencollege.ubc.ca/about">UBC Green College</a>, and supported by the <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/globalhumanities.html">SFU Department of Global Humanities</a>. The talk is titled <strong>Texts in Motion: World Literature during the Chinese Cultural Revolution</strong> and will take place at SFU Harbour Centre 515 W Hastings St HC 7000 Earl &amp; Jennie Policy Room.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abstract:
The Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) is perceived as an era when China was cut off from the rest of the world, politically as much as culturally; and as an era of cultural and literary deprivation dominated by censorship and by government control of literary and artistic production. While this certainly held true for large parts of the population, the Cultural Revolution also saw an erosion of this system, if not an implosion: Countless uprooted youth – be they former Red Guards and/or educated youth sent to the countryside from 1968 onwards – read whatever they could get their hands and eyes on: books marked for destruction because of their counterrevolutionary nature as much as internal publications that were produced only for the eyes of trustworthy party cadres. This latter category contained large amounts of foreign literature translated into Chinese. Very often, the children of party cadres took these books to the countryside and shared them with friends, as described in Dai Sijie’s novel Balzac and the Chinese Seamstress. Thus, the Cultural Revolution, for many, was a time of great intellectual freedom, and of broadening their horizons beyond their own country. In this presentation, Professor Henningsen will, first, chart actual reading practices through a sample of autobiographical writings to delineate which texts were read at the time and considered noteworthy in retrospect. She will demonstrate that foreign literature, ranging from Dumas to the authors of the beat generation, featured prominently in this. Second, she will turn to literary creation of the time: handwritten entertainment fiction which circulated clandestinely. While these texts appear to be “mere” entertainment at first glance, they are intertextual and – mirroring actual reading practices – anchor the genre firmly on a map of world literature. Discussing three different stories and the intertextual links within them, Professor Henningsen will delineate the different cosmopolitanisms of the Cultural Revolution and how they forestalled developments of the early post-Mao years.</p>

<p>Last but not least, on <strong>Wednesday, March 22, from 4:00-5:30pm</strong>, Lena will share insights into her new resaerch on Chinese comics in a talk titled <strong>“Lost in Adaptation? Lu Xun and his Works in Chinese Lianhuanhua 连环画”</strong> at the <a href="https://ccr.ubc.ca/">Centre for Chinese Research, UBC</a> in Room 120 Vancouver Campus, Institute of Asian Research, C.K. Choi Building, 1855 West Mall.</p>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="/assets/images/lena-vancouver3.png" alt="" /></span></p>

<p>For details, see <a href="https://ccr.ubc.ca/events/event/dr-lena-henningsen-lost-in-adaptation-lu-xun-and-his-works-in-chinese-lianhuanhua-%E8%BF%9E%E7%8E%AF%E7%94%BB/">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abstract:
Lu Xun and his works have been remediated through Chinese comics: lianhuanhua 连环画, literally “linked images”. Many of the literary works of the founding father of modern Chinese literature have been adapted into comic form, often in several versions, and his biography has likewise been told in comics. In this talk, I will analyze a corpus of 30-40 lianhuanhua to sketch the characteristics of these remediations through the lens of reading: First of all, these works represent readings of Lu Xun by other artists. Secondly, as a very popular medium during the Mao years they provided contemporary readers with accessible versions of the texts of the modernist writer, mass-media versions of the literary texts so to speak. Thirdly, in portraying Lu Xun reading, they present the reader with a model of how to become a proper reader for themselves, of how to read and of how to give meaning to reading. In my talk, I will disentangle the propagandistic aspects from the literary, providing answers to the following questions: What versions of Lu Xun and his texts were produced in the lianhuanhua? In how far do these changing versions represent changing discourses about literary values and the roles ascribed to literature? What is the role of mechanisms of mise-en-abyme? Combining close readings of the visual and textual aspects of the comics, I will trace the processes of adaptation. I will argue that on the surface the comics follow discourses propagating Lu Xun as the revolutionary writer as which Mao Zedong wanted to see him. At first glance, many adaptations seem to simplify the stories of Lu Xun, and the ambivalence of the originals is lost in adaptation. Taking the visuals of the medium seriously, however, I will argue that the lianhuanhua rescue the modernist author from propagandistic appropriation.</p>
