		<p>A new edited volume in the series <em>Jahrbuch der Deutschen Vereinigung für Chinastudien (Yearbook of the German Association for Chinese Studies)</em> has just been published – and in it, three chapters written by members of the READCHINA team!</p>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="/assets/images/dvcs19-cover.png" alt="" /></span></p>

<p>Edited by <a href="https://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/de/personen/academic-staff/wissenschaftler-personendetails/persdetail/hofmann.html">Martin Hofmann</a> and <a href="https://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/people/academic-staff/details/persdetail/kurtz.html">Joachim Kurtz</a>, the volume collects a dozen contributions related to the vast topic of ‘sites of knowledge’ and related questions of spatial dimensions of knowledge production and dissemination in China. For details on the book, see <a href="https://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/Wissensorte_in_China/titel_7372.ahtml">here</a>. An Open Access version of all chapters will also be available a year after publication. In the meantime, if you are interested in reading any of the READCHINA contributions, simply <a href="mailto:readchina.erc@gmail.com">get in touch with us</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Damian-Mandzunowski">Damian Mandzunowski’s</a> chapter is titled: Factory State of Mind: Spreading “Three Ardent Loves” via Collective Reading Activities in Tianjin, 1983–1985, abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reading groups, the organizational structure arising from state-sanctioned collective reading activities, were a common occurrence in most workplaces of the People’s Republic of China from the 1950s until the 1990s. Industrial factories in particular were sites where knowledge was created, disseminated, and performed in reading groups in direct communication with the party-state’s subjects. This paper discusses the case of reading activities aiming to advance workers’ “ardent love for the motherland, for socialism, and for the party” in Tianjin in the early 1980s. By showing where the readings took place, analyzing what was read, and describ- ing the guidance of the activities, the paper reveals how the Chinese industrial space—a site for producing goods—became a site for producing political knowledge.</p>

<p><a href="https://readchina.github.io/team/eve.html">Eve Y. Lin’s</a> chapter is titled “Cultural Biography of the “Avant-Garde”: Intellectual Bookstores and the Legacy of High Culture”, abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Nanjing-based bookstore “Librairie Avant-Garde” is an intellectual bookstore with cultural influence in contemporary China. Situated in a consumer society today, but also established as a place representing the high culture legacy of the 1980s China, this bookstore becomes a site where commercialization and the counter-drive of cultural autonomy intertwine. The ideal of cultural autonomy, embedded in the 1980s high culture legacy, is evoked by the bookstore in its employment of the mutating concept of the “avant-garde” over the years. This paper takes the bookstore as a case study to consider China’s high culture legacy since the 1980s. From the perspective of a cultural biography of places, the paper argues that, rather than causing a neat rupture in China’s cultural field, the ever-broader extent of commercialization in post-Mao China’s social life since the 1990s does not replace its high culture legacy as much as it casts the latter into a prolonged process of adjustment with the consumer culture. As a result, distinctions between the highbrow and the popular, modernism and postmodernism, spiritual autonomy and consumerist self-indulgence have become highly ambiguous in post-1990 China.</p>

<p>Lena Henningsen’s chapter is titled “Fictional Texts as Sites of Knowledge: From Intertexts to Transtextuality”, abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many fictional characters in Chinese literature are avid readers of literary prose, poetry, fiction, and nonfiction. This establishes a distinct web of texts, and thus patterns of intertextuality. Their reading acts often characterize these fictional characters. In literary texts produced after 1949, they are positioned clearly within the ideological framework set up by the literary dogma of the CCP. This dogma called upon the readers of fiction to emulate literary heroes. Using this as a starting point, I analyze the short story “Banzhuren” (The Class Teacher) by Liu Xinwu, published shortly after the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). The multitude of texts read and discussed within this piece of fiction clearly locates the story within the literary and intellectual cosmos of the time. Moreover, the intertexts transform the story into a site where literary knowledge is debated, contested, and produced. Reading acts thus produce a site of knowledge within the fictional narrative. The short story offers interpretations of the intertexts and attains distinct meaning through the various texts referred to and discussed. At the same time, the interpretations of these intertexts mirror how the readers of “Banzhuren” may have perceived them. The short story and the texts referred to form what I call a “transtextual space.” Taking into account the fictional nature of the text, I argue that this particular type of transtextuality creates distinct imaginary spaces.</p>

<p>Happy reading!</p>
