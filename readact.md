### {{ page.title }}: Introduction
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/96089230.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/96089230)

The *ReadAct* database was originally developed as part of the Worlds of Reading in China’s long 1970s research project [*Lesewelten*](http://www.sinologie.uni-freiburg.de/forschung/projecthenningsen). It is under active development as part of [*READCHINA*](https://readchina.github.io/).

*ReadAct* provides various interfaces for users to interact with its data. This page features a collection of graphical displays accompanied by short snippets of analysis. These views are updated automatically and reflect the latest stage of our ongoing work on *ReadAct*. It is therefore possible that the text and the visualization are not in perfect alignment. Should you note something odd, please let us know via the contact form. You can freely explore and interact with the views by selecting `Open in Vega Editor` from the menu button on any data visualization. The short data stories here provide a space for quick explorations based on our overarching research questions. For fuller analysis please consult the publications section of our homepage.

### Reading books (and more)
One of the first questions one might ask, is which books have been read during the cultural revolution? According to autobiographical accounts we can see that *The Water Margin* a novel about … was the most widely read novel.

Yet, reading can also take an extended sense, beyond the confines of literary works. We therefore took a closer look at other works of art, such as movies, paintings, or even music that was *read* according to the accounts of those remembering their life during the CR.

Side-by-side both queries show that the consumption of art, and reading in particular did (not?) adhere to …

### Popular authors
The previous views look at individual works, to determine popular creators, we need to group works belonging to the same author together. It should come as no surprise that Mao Zedong is the most popular creator of works being read within our data-set. However, looking at other popular choices, we see that next to Karl Marx (another usual suspect), Lu Xun and Alexandre Dumas are on equal footing.

It seems that the classics, both Chinese and foreign, continued to be very popular in spite of revolutionary rhetoric.
