Abstract of the edited volume:
>Understanding Authenticity in Chinese Cultural Heritage explores the construction of "authenticity" and its consequences in relation to Chinese cultural heritage—those objects, texts, and intangible practices concerned with China’s past. This book launch will provide an opportunity to learn about the volume and its content, ask questions of the editors and contributors, and for contributors, editors, commentator/discussant, and audience to enter into broader discussions on the matter of authenticity debates in China and beyond. After an introduction by one of the editors Dr Hein, Mr Qian will provide comments and then lead everyone through discussions structured into the four sub-sections of the volume: Art and Material Culture, Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation, Living and Intangible Cultural Heritage, and Texts and Manuscripts.
