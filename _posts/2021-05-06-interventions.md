The __READCHINA__ team is excited to announce the start of our online publication series: the [__READCHINA *Interventions*__](https://readchina.github.io/interventions.html)! In this new section, we will publish brief pieces with core insights gained from our project(s) and ongoing deliberations by individual researchers about relevant concepts. We are expanding these thoughts in our previous and forthcoming [publications](https://readchina.github.io/publications.html) too. Our intention in writing the READCHINA Interventions is to spark conversation and provoke thoughts, so we hope you enjoy reading them â€“ and feel free to reach out to us with comments afterward!

Our first two Interventions are out now too. The __READCHINA *Intervention* 01__, written by our PI [JunProf. Dr. Lena Henningsen](https://www.sinologie.uni-freiburg.de/Mitarbeiterinnen/professorinnen/henningsen), deals with the core question "What is a Reading Act?" In a word, the concept emphasizes the event-like nature of reading by focusing on the readers and the contexts under which readings take place -- but to get the whole picture, click [here](https://readchina.github.io/interventions/What_is.html).

The __READCHINA *Intervention* 02__, coauthored by [Damian Mandzunowski](https://www.sinologie.uni-freiburg.de/Mitarbeiterinnen/projektmitarbeiterinnen/mandzunowski) and Lena Henningsen, is slightly more provocative. In asking "Why Poach When You Can Wander?" it deals with the impactful yet (from today's viewpoint) somewhat problematic metaphor of reading-as-poaching proposed by Michel de Certeau. However, rather than discard is as a whole, we seek and explore a range of alternative ideas and metaphors both found in de Certeau's writings and proposed by us. Head [here](https://readchina.github.io/interventions/poaching.html) to read what we ended up with!
