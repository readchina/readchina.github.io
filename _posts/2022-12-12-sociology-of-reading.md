Two members of the READCHINA team have contributed chapters to a just-published edited volume titled [*The Cultural Sociology of Reading: The Meanings of Reading and Books Across the World*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-13227-8]), edited by [María Angélica Thumala Olave](https://edinburgh.academia.edu/AngelicaThumala) with Palgrave Macmillan.

About the book:
>This book showcases recent work about reading and books in sociology and the humanities across the globe. From different standpoints and within the broad perspectives within the cultural sociology of reading, the eighteen chapters examine a range of reading practices, genres, types of texts, and reading spaces. They cover the Anglophone area of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia; the transnational, multilingual space constituted by the readership of the Colombian novel One Hundred Years of Solitude; nineteenth-century Chile; twentieth-century Czech Republic; twentieth century Swahili readings in East Africa; contemporary Iran; and China during the cultural revolution and the post-Mao period. The chapters contribute to current debates about the valuation of literature and the role of cultural intermediaries; the iconic properties of textual objects and of the practice of reading itself; how reading supports personal, social and political reflection; bookstores as spaces for sociability and the interplay of high and commercial cultures; the political uses of reading for nation-building and propaganda, and the dangers and gratifications of reading under repression. In line with the cultural sociology of reading’s focus on meaning, materiality and emotion, this book explores the existential, ethical and political consequences of reading in specific locations and historical moments. 

Eve Y. Lin wrote a chapter under the title ["Between Avant-Garde and Kitsch: Intellectual Bookstores and Post-Mao China’s Reading Culture"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-13227-8_15), abstract:
>Post-Mao China’s reading culture, and individual reading in particular, is in constant transformation along with other radical cultural-political transformations in Chinese social life. For the study of post-Mao China’s reading culture, the intellectual bookstore provides an insightful angle for observation. This type of private-run bookstore offers a tangible site in which actual reading activities and actual readers can be observed. It also straddles Chinese high culture and consumer culture and witnesses the shift of cultural trends in contemporary Chinese society. This chapter combines a sociology of (reading) culture with a more intimate cultural sociology of reading. First, by charting the emergence and impacts of individual reading and the historical developments of private-run bookstores in post-Mao China, this chapter macroscopically demonstrates the shift of the Chinese reading culture from a high modernist inclination for the “avant-garde” to the up-and-coming consumer culture, the latter of which could be regarded as “kitsch.” Then, focusing on two case studies of intellectual bookstores in Beijing and Nanjing respectively, this chapter reveals a more nuanced and intricate picture of the interplays between the avant-garde and kitsch in post-Mao China’s reading culture under constant change.

Lena Henningsen's chapter is titled ["The Functions of Reading in Chinese Literature and Society"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-13227-8_19), abstract:
>Starting with the premise that reading always has cognitive, sensory, and emotive attributes, in this contribution to a cultural sociology of reading, I focus on Chinese reading culture during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Both early twentieth-century reformers and communist revolutionaries believed in the power of literature as a tool to remold the population into mature readers and citizens and to contribute to the creation of a modern Chinese nation. Chinese citizens were thus educated in a mode of normative reading: people were to take socialist realist heroes as models in their own lives. Similarly, authors of literary texts were to base fictional protagonists on famous Soviet prototypes, thereby translating the mode of normative reading into Chinese fiction. In the second part of the chapter, I trace reading acts in fictional texts. These point to a mechanism involving mutual meaning generation. First, through a fictional reading act, two texts—the text being read and the text in which this text is read—are linked to each other, I argue, one serving as interface to the other and thus impacting on how real-life readers interpret both texts. Second, these reading acts demonstrate that literary texts contributed to the establishment of the mode of normative reading while at the same time challenging it.
