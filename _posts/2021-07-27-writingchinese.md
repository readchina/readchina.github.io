READCHINA's Principal Investigator [Lena Henningsen](https://www.sinologie.uni-freiburg.de/Mitarbeiterinnen/professorinnen/henningsen) is on the editorial board of a new open-access double-blind peer reviewed academic journal titled 'Writing Chinese: A Journal of Contemporary Sinophone Literature' -- and the [call for papers for its first issue](https://writingchinesejournal.org/announcement/) has just been announced!

>We are delighted to share the first Call for Papers from Writing Chinese: A Journal of Contemporary Sinophone Literature (WCJ). This new journal, published by White Rose University Press, showcases the latest peer-reviewed academic research on contemporary Chinese-language literature and its translation and global reception, alongside features on practitioners. WCJâ€™s combination of academic articles and practice-based notes provides a platform for, and facilitates dialogue between, both primary and secondary actors in the field. A key objective of the journal is to engage directly with scholarship in East Asia and throughout the Sinosphere, and so one section in each issue will feature newly commissioned English translations of the latest Chinese-language research.

Consult [the journal's website](https://writingchinesejournal.org/about/call-for-papers/) for all details about the CfP and the submission guidelines. Expressions of interest should be addressed, in the first instance, to the Editors at [writingchinese@leeds.ac.uk](mailto:writingchinese@leeds.ac.uk), as should any general enquiries about the journal.
