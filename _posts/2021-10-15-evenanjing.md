READCHINA’s [Eve Y. Lin](https://readchina.github.io/team/eve.html) presented on October 16, 2021, her latest research based on a 5-month field trip in China (June to October 2021) as part of her ongoing dissertational project at a __[conference on the transmedial studies of arts](https://wemp.app/posts/29e60578-fabf-478b-bf27-0e1ac8fc0a51)__ held at the [School of Arts, Nanjing University](https://art.nju.edu.cn/main.htm). Her talk was on Saturday October 16, 2021, at 17:00 (Beijing time).

The English abstract of her talk follows below:

>"Avant-garde” (先锋) was developed into a highly influential cultural idea/ideal in the PRC during the 1980s. However, recognized as a buzzword for the 1980s Chinese society and regarded as representative of the High Culture legacy left by that dacade, the nature and the cultural knowledge of the Chinese avant-garde remain rather chameleonic and vague. As China’s social life marches to an ever-broader extend of consumerism since the 1990s, the nature of “avant-garde” has undergone even more radical mutations and become more ambiguous. This talk traces how the concept of “avant-garde” mutated over the years in the Chinese society since the 1990s by looking into the development of Contemporary China’s private-run bookstores.
Maintaining that the bookstore provides simultaneously sensory and symbolic sites in which cultural knowledge is constructed, staged, perfomed, and constantly reconstructed, this paper analyzes the changing contents of the Chinese avant-garde that are inscribed in and performed through the textual, spatial, and material media provided by various bookstores over different periods of time. Furthermore, the changing natures of the avant-garde revealed by the bookstores indicate an intertwined state between the 1980’s high culture legacy and contemporary China’s consumer.
