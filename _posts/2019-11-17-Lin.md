## Transformations and Social Implications of China's Private-Run Bookstores

After more than a decade’s crisis of closing down, private-run bookstores in China have burgeoned in quantity and scale in the last few years.
Today’s “transformed” and “upgraded” bookstores reveal the pandemic consumerism in China’s social life. The peculiar roles those bookstores play serve as a central index of the degree and characteristics of consumerism in the Chines society today.
Moreover, those bookstores also carry the latest cultural-political strategy of the PRC, influenced by both the logic of a typical consumer society and the governmental cultural regulation inherited from the earlier period of the PRC.
