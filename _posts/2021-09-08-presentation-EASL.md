[Matthias Arnold](https://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/de/personen/person/persdetail/arnold.html), [Duncan Paterson](https://www.sinologie.uni-freiburg.de/Mitarbeiterinnen/projektmitarbeiterinnen/duncanpaterson) and [Jia Xie](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jia-Xie) presented the results of their research into practical implications of FAIR data principles in PRC research data platforms at the [41st Annual Conference of the European Association of Sinological Librarians](http://easl.org/min.html).

From the abstract:
>It is tempting to assume that FAIR data principles effectively apply globally. In practice, digital research platforms play a central role in ensuring the applicability of these principles to EU – PRC research exchanges. For this article we conduct a systematic literature review of research into Chinese Republican newspapers as it appears in popular research data catalogues. We experimentally compare the results of repeated search runs using different interfaces and with different points of origin. We then analyze our results regarding the practical and technical accessibility conditions. Concluding with an analysis of conceptual mismatches surrounding the classification of items as “full-text“, and of a case of total data loss that is nevertheless symptomatic of the limited degree of data re-usability. Our results show the structural challenges preventing Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Re-usability to be put into practice.
