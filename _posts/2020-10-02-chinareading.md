[Damian Mandzunowski](https://readchina.github.io/team/damian.html) has been curating a digital repository of images of people engaging in the act of reading in China during the long twentieth century. Mainly consisting of photographs, the ongoing collection shall eventually also include other visual textsâ€”posters, paintings, and films.
