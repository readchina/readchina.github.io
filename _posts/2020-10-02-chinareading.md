*READCHINA*'s [Damian Mandzunowski](https://readchina.github.io/team/damian.html) is curating a [digital repository](https://chinareading.wordpress.com/) of images of people engaging in the act of reading in China during the long twentieth century. Although other visual texts—such as posters, paintings, and films—shall be eventually included in the collection as well, its primary focus is on photographic depictions of reading.

When discussing the relationship between photography and history, Roland Barthes [suggested](https://books.google.com/books?id=AtJmxgEACAAJ) that they add layers of “infraknowledge” to the researched subject; layers only hardly found elsewhere. The initial idea to start the collection of photographs of reading acts arose from a similar desire: to assemble a large body of evidence that can potentially expand our understanding of where, when and how people in China consumed texts. Given that, as [described](https://books.google.com/books?id=LgQRiXDIRKYC) by John Berger, photographs "quote from appearances", and that, as Susan Sontag impactfully [theorized](https://books.google.com/books?id=uZ-sBAAAQBAJ), photographs are “an ethics of seeing” that "miniaturize experience [and] transform history into spectacle”, the images here collected need to be seen in the given context of their creation and (intended) usages. Yet, and herein perhaps lies the essential power of images, first and foremost these photographs transfer us in time and space; they invite us to read over the shoulder of the historic reader in China.
