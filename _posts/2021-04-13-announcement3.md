READCHINA's [Damian Mandzunowski](https://www.sinologie.uni-freiburg.de/Mitarbeiterinnen/projektmitarbeiterinnen/mandzunowski) will present on <b>21 April at 4 pm</b> during the international lecture series ["Jiang Qing’s Last Revolution: Exploring Alternative Understandings of China’s Past"](https://sinologie.univie.ac.at/en/events/details/news/lecture-series-jiang-qings-last-revolution-exploring-alternative-understanding-of-chinas-past/?tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&cHash=4c12da852881c9c9e80f3345bb8b091f) organized by Silvia Salino at the Department of East Asian Studies at the University of Vienna.

This talk will shed light on visual traces of Jiang Qing in the historical and cultural records that are caricatures created during the campaign to expose, criticize and investigate the Gang of Four in 1976-78. For a few years before and during the radical phase of the Cultural Revolution—roughly from the mid-1960s to the early-1970s—Jiang Qing was widely present: her persona graced propaganda posters and photographs, the model works created under her supervision were staged nationwide and their filmed versions shown in cinemas, and her writings on art and literature were popularized alongside her recommendations for revolutionary attire. Then, in fall 1976, she was gone. Arrested alongside three other former top party leaders and collectively branded a Gang of Four (also known as the “counter-revolutionary Jiang Qing clique”), all new visual depictions of her were banned and the already-existing ones hidden, edited and pulped. Yet, already in early winter of the same year, Jiang Qing was back on countless posters plastered on walls and on signs held up high during mass-manifestations. This time, however, the depictions were far from glamorizing. This talk will showcase some of the most prevailing visual tropes present in the images as well as discuss their larger social-historical meanings. The talk will also exemplify how the visual language of the caricatures was not only closely related to ongoing political transformations of the period, but also intrinsically gendered. In addition, given that Jiang Qing remains a vivid element in Chinese (and global) pop-cultural collective memory, the talk will then investigate how this iconography was (and still is) re-used and re-constructed long after the defamation campaign ended.
