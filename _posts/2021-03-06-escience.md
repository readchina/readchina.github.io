[Matthias Arnold](https://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/de/personen/person/persdetail/arnold.html) presented the prelimary findings about *Procedural Challenges: Machine Learning Tasks for OCR of Historical CJK Newspapers* on behalf of the joint research with [Duncan Paterson](https://www.sinologie.uni-freiburg.de/Mitarbeiterinnen/projektmitarbeiterinnen/duncanpaterson) and [Jia Xie](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jia-Xie) at the virtual [E-Science-Tage 2021: Share Your Research Data](https://e-science-tage.de) conference. 

The joint research looks at the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in digitizing historical CJK documents and the procedural difficulties with accessibility and reusability of similar research conducted in the PRC. The final results are scheduled to appear in a forthcoming special issue on "Digital Humanities and East Asian Studies" in the *International Journal of Digital Humanities*.
