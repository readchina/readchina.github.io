Dayton Lekner has been awarded a prestigious Alexander von Humboldt fellowship and will join the institute in spring 2021 and cooperate with the READCHINA team. Lekner will work on a social history of listening in the Mao era PRC, taking a three-tiered approach to explore state intent, local practices, and individual perceptions of the sonic during the formative years of the PRC.  We are looking forward to welcoming him in Freiburg!
