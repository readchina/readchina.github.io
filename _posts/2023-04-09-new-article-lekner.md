title: New Article on Reading Out Loud in Cold War Chinas by Dayton Lekner
---

We are happy to share a new research article by READCHINA affiliated scholar Dr Dayton Lekner titled "States of Diffusion: Ideology, Text, Voice, and Sound in Cold War Chinas". 

The article asks, What happens when we read aloud? What had been text on a page or screen becomes first the internal and then physical voice of the reader, then sound waves that reflect off and are coloured by the physical space of the reading, commingle with other sounds in that space, and are finally apprehended by the listener. At each stage the text, however singular its purpose, becomes something new. In this article, published recently in [Modern China](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00977004221123511), Dayton Lekner explores the various stages of diffusion of a text through voice across ideological and national border with the study of sonic propaganda across the Taiwan Strait from 1953 to 1991.

Abstract:
> From 1953 to 1991, speaker installations on the coasts of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan sent audio signals back and forth between the two Cold War foes. This opposed amplification and diffusion of sound continued for nearly four decades, employed thousands of “callers,” technicians, station managers, scriptwriters, and other staff, and was heard by successive generations of troops and civilians on both sides. Previous research on the use of sound for mobilization and subjectification in China during this era has focused on the authoritarian, revolutionary, or even totalitarian nature of sonic statecraft. This article, drawing on state archives, memoirs, and interviews, compares the goals, infrastructure, and voices of the two sides to suggest a broader and more transnational framework for understanding acts of sonic propaganda and control, representative not of “communist” or “free” China, but as a diffusion of the state voice into acts of listening between states. It also explores how the opposed initiatives of both sides interacted and influenced each other over years of call and response. Finally, it examines the civilian response to the broadcasts, revealing plural modes of listening, and of apprehending both oneself and one’s enemy. I offer the metaphor of “diffusion” not only to describe the process by which states and individuals positioned themselves through the transmission and reception of sonic impulses, but as a way to do social history that focuses on the multiple receptions and reverberations of an event.
