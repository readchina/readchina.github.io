My research focuses on Post-Mao Chinese society, especially on the changes in China’s cultural field under the impacts of commercialization and consumerism during the last 30 years. More specifically, I am currently working on a study of privately-run commercial bookstores in present-day P. R. China. In it I intend to: 1. excavate the social functions of those bookstores and the roles of today’s readers-consumers, 2. observe the reader-consumer’s way of interacting with the bookstores, and 3. shed light on the nature and traits of contemporary Chinese society through the insights gained in these bookstores.

I have previously been trained in literary criticism (English literature) and cultural studies. With my current research on Chinese society and with my new training in sociology, I find it as challenging as it is full of opportunity in the process of expanding of my research fields. With reasonable hope, I expect to bring about a comprehensive view, a comparative awareness, and resourceful and sensible methodological choosing in my study of the contemporary Chinese reading culture.
