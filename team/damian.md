### Damian Mandzunowski (PhD Candidate)

I am a student of modern Chinese history. In my dissertation, I focus on reading groups for workers and cadres organized during the transition between the Mao (1949-1976) and early reform eras (1976-1992) in the People’s Republic of China. Placed at the crossroads of contemporary political history, critical social research and media/communication studies, the dissertation aims to advance our understanding of how the party in power employed reading groups in the system of state propaganda. Although mass campaigns slowly gave way to other forms of direct political communication with the dawn of economic reforms and opening-up, reading groups—albeit in forms adaptive to social trends and political goals—persist until today. Basing my research on archival sources and oral history interviews, this project is a close investigation into the reading practices, the contents studied and the policies behind them. In the end, I hope to discover both the position held by collective reading activities in the everyday lives of vast groups of people and their importance for the sustaining of the party-state.

My other research interests include Chinese film, visual narratives and contemporary art.
