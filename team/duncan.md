### Duncan Paterson
My research project inquires online literature as a distinct form of both textual production and more importantly consumption. Reading of digital narratives is a culturally distinct form of digital reading in the ways that readers and authors interact, in editorial practices, the legal framework for publication, and in the way that the material conditions of the work can go beyond the constraints of the codex.

My attempts at understanding digital narratives on their own terms, are informed by my background in book history more broadly, and in my research into the history of printing in China. Unlike with 16<sup>th</sup> century xylographs, the study of born digital contents, enables extensive use of computational analysis, NLP, TOPICs, etc.

I have a background in software development, digital editions, and data modeling. Within *READCHINA* I function as digirati at large responsible for the technical aspects and implementation of our research data collection, data publication, and computation analysis methods. You can find out more about my programming work on my [Github Profile](https://github.com/duncdrum)
