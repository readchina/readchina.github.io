I am a post-doctoral researcher in the ERC funded project ‘Politics of Reading in the PRC’ at University of Freiburg. In 2019, I received my doctoral degree in Cultural Studies from SOAS University of London in 2019. My thesis title is Archaism as Cultural Distinction: Woodblock Book Publishing During the Mao Era 1949 – 1976. Before this, I did my MA in cultural studies at SOAS in 2014, and BA in Japanese language and literature at Nanjing University in 1997. My works have appeared on East Asian Publishing and Society and PRC History Review. My research interests include book history, cultural studies, Chinese history, and modern Chinese culture and literature.
