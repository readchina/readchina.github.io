				<p>Research into literary and intellectual life often focuses on
					analyses of texts and their production. The reader, practices of reading and the meanings and
					interpretations that (ordinary) readers arrive at very often are missing from the picture. This
					lecture series aims at filling this gap in research by focusing on practices of reading in the
					People’s Republic of China, addressing, among others, the following questions:
				<ul>
					<li>How do individuals, or groups of individuals, adapt to, oppose or appropriate official politics
						by creating their own, private politics of reading?</li>
					<li>In how far is (or was) reading an individual or a group activity, a private or public
						undertaking?</li>
					<li>Where are (or were) practices of reading situated within a triangle made up of the poles of
						leisure, mandatory and forbidden reading?</li>
					<li>How open or clandestine are (or were) practices of reading, are (or were) they legal or illegal?
						In how far is (or was) reading employed as a means of distinction?</li>
					<li>In how far does this relate back to the ways that texts are written, distributed, marketed, and
						interpreted officially?</li>
					<li>When reading becomes part of official policies, what happens to the everyday lives of readers?
					</li>
					<li>How do different media, different materiality of reading materials impact on reading practices
						and on the interpretation thereof?</li>
				</ul>
